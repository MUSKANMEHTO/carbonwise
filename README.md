🌿 CarbonWise – Premium Dashboard

The CarbonWise Dashboard is a modern, fully responsive sustainability analytics interface built using React (Functional Components), Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, and Framer Motion. It delivers a clean SaaS-style experience with eco-inspired green gradients, glassmorphism cards, soft shadows, and smooth animations to reflect a professional AI-powered carbon tracking platform.

The dashboard features animated KPI cards displaying Total Carbon This Month, Percentage Change from Last Month (color-coded for improvement or increase), Trees Equivalent Saved (1 tree = 21kg CO₂/year), and a Sustainability Score calculated as 100 − (totalEmission / 2). Below the KPIs, interactive charts include a Bar Chart for emissions by category, a Pie Chart for percentage breakdown, a Weekly Trend Line Chart with gradient fill, and a Radar Chart for lifestyle impact analysis.

Additional components include a Carbon Budget Tracker with a 150kg default limit and color-coded progress bar, an AI Forecast panel predicting monthly emissions using avgDailyEmission × 30, a GitHub-style activity heatmap for daily emission intensity, a mini leaderboard, and an achievement & badge system. The layout is optimized for all devices, supports dark mode toggle, and uses smooth animations and transitions throughout to create a premium, engaging user experience. 🌿
